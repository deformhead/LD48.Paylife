# LD48.Paylife

Welcome ! [Paylife](https://deformhead.github.io/LD48.Paylife/index.html) ([Ludum Dare 44 Theme: Your life is currency](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/ld48-paylife)) is built in plain HTML5/JavaScript with a framework I am developping.

I challenged myself creating this game in only 24h instead of the regular 48h !

## Overview

Rules :

- it is a mouse-only game
- you have 60s to break your best score
- clicking on cards cost life
- cards increase life per second releasing hearts
- catch hearts to gain life
- when an heart flies away, you lose 1 life

I'd like to :

- add sfx

This was my second Game Jam, so I hope you'll like this game. Thank you for your support.
